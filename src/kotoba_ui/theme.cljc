  "One theme map = the ONLY styling entry an app needs.

  Consumers of this stack used to hand-write hundreds of lines of page CSS
  (invented hex colors, per-appearance palettes, specificity fights) because
  there was no single place to say \"this is my accent, this is my
  appearance\". This namespace is that place:

    {:accent      \"#RRGGBB\"       ;; optional; default = HIG tint (system blue)
     :accent-dark \"#RRGGBB\"       ;; optional; defaults to :accent
     :appearance  :auto|:light|:dark ;; default :auto (follow the OS)
     :hig        {...} :hig-dark  {...}   ;; raw shitsuke.hig token override
     :glass      {...} :glass-dark {...}} ;; raw liquid-glass token override

  `theme-css` threads the accent into shitsuke.hig's `:hig/color :tint`
  token and liquid-glass's `:liquid-glass/accent` token group and emits the
  complete page CSS in canonical order (layer-order declaration exactly once,
  first; then the HIG bundle, the glass bundle, and the shell structural
  rules). The raw `:hig`/`:glass` maps are escape hatches for anything
  beyond the accent — same shapes as each library's own override maps.

  Portable .cljc, zero third-party deps, babashka-safe (no `format`, no
  reader conditionals — hex parsing is done with a digit lookup string)."
