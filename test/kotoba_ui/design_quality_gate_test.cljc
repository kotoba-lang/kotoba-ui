(ns kotoba-ui.design-quality-gate-test
  "Self-scoring design-quality gate (ADR-2607132300: an unmeasured metric is
  theater).

  Renders representative FULL pages with kotoba-ui.core/->page — the same
  one-call entry every consumer uses — and scores the actual emitted HTML +
  inline CSS with kotoba-lang/design-quality's deterministic HIG/WCAG audit
  (full 12-axis rubric, `:extra-axes`). The gate asserts the aggregate and
  each page stay at or above a floor set from the honestly measured score
  minus a small margin, so any regression in the shell/page/theme output
  (dropping the viewport meta, losing safe-area insets, reintroducing bare
  100vh, ...) fails `clojure -M:test` before it ships.

  Measured on 2026-07-13 (design-quality @ 36c03d4):
    worked-example 87.18 / bare-shell 92.18 / dense-console 87.18
    aggregate 88.84
  The gap to 100 is upstream liquid-glass-ui, not this repo (recorded as
  follow-ups in the PR): `:tap-targets` (buttons carry no explicit
  min-height >= 44px) and `:input-zoom` (a 13px font on the checkbox
  checkmark pseudo-element `...checkbox-input:checked ~ ...::after` that the
  heuristic reads as a text-field rule). When those land upstream, re-measure
  and RAISE these floors — never lower them to make a regression pass."
