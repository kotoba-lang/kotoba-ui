(ns kotoba-ui.kotoba-shell-style-parity-test
  "Byte-equality gate between the pure string logic of `kotoba-ui.shell.style`
  / `kotoba-ui.product` and its `.kotoba` form-A port
  (kotoba/shell_style_core.kotoba) — ADR-2607270100 section 10, continuing the
  kotoba-ui step after kotoba/theme_core.kotoba.

  The `.cljc` is unchanged and remains the oracle; kotoba-lang/compiler stays
  a test-only dependency. Same harness shape as kotoba-parity-test /
  kotoba-document-parity-test: each case is a zero-arg `.kotoba` defn appended
  to the port source, compiled with `kotoba.compiler.core/compile-source` and
  run through `kotoba.kir/execute` in this same JVM.

  Assertions are against the real `kotoba-ui` functions and, for the three
  composed declaration values, against the value read back out of the LIVE
  `shell-rules` set — not a literal re-typed into the test. `shell-layer-css`
  is fed the real host-rendered rule text and the real media block and must
  reproduce `shell-css` byte for byte.

  What stayed host-side and why is listed in the port source header."
